# Data Portal

## Introduction
The Data Portal provides information on the work supported by the **Barts Health Data Platform** and how to access patient data through our application and review process.

## Application Process
The application process has been developed to encompass a range of different request types (i.e., research, service evaluation, clincal audit, quality improvement) that may require additional information and additional approvals from both within and outside the hospital. 
If this information and approvals are not in place, then you can always save a draft of the application form and return later. We also support two approval types: full (when you have all the approvals and funding in palce and you are ready to process data) and provisional (when you are still at the planning phase and would like an agreement in principal).
You do not need to get a provisional approval before applying for full approval. Nor does a provisional approval mean that your full approval will automatically be a success, but it allows any concerns we may have with your request to be addressed ahead of the full request.

The stages needed to complete the online form are identfied below:
1. Create an account on [data.bartshealth.nhs.uk](data.bartshealth.nhs.uk) if you do not already have one.
2. Once you have an account, log on to the Data Portal and select the MyDARs (Data Access Requests) tab. This is where your draft, submitted and approved requests can be found.
3. In the Drafts section there is a button to 'Sunmit a Data Access Request' which will start your application process. You can move forward and backward through the form, with your overall progress through the process indicated, until you reach the final page where you will be asked to save a draft or submit the request for processing.
4. Once you have submitted your request their progress through our processes will be indicated in the middle table. These stages are:
   * Verification
   * Review
   * Applicant Feedback
   * DAC
5. Once approved by the DAC they will appear in the lower table while the project administration is completed, your data prepared and your SDE workspace established.
