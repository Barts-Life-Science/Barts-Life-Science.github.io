# Data Portal

## Introduction
The Data Portal provides information on the work supported by the **Barts Health Data Platform** and how to access patient data through our application and review process.

## Application Process
The application process has been developed to encompass a range of different request types (i.e., research, service evaluation, clincal audit, quality improvement) that may require additional information and additional approvals from both within and outside the hospital. 
If this information and approvals are not in place, then you can always save a draft of the application form and return later. We also support two approval types: full (when you have all the approvals and funding in palce and you are ready to process data) and provisional (when you are still at the planning phase and would like an agreement in principal).
You do not need to get a provisional approval before applying for full approval. Nor does a provisional approval mean that your full approval will automatically be a success, but it allows any concerns we may have with your request to be addressed ahead of the full request.

The stages needed to complete the online form are identfied below:
1. Create an account on [data.bartshealth.nhs.uk](https://data.bartshealth.nhs.uk) if you do not already have one.
2. Once you have an account, log on to the Data Portal and select the MyDARs (Data Access Requests) tab. This is where your draft, submitted and approved requests can be found.
3. In the Draft Applications section there is a button to 'Sunmit a Data Access Request' which will start your application process. You can move forward and backward through the [form](form.html), with your overall progress through the process indicated, until you reach the final page where you will be asked to save a draft or submit the request for processing. You can return back to draft applications to either view or edit the request using the menu option on each row.
4. Once you have submitted your request their progress through our processes will be indicated in the middle table. These stages are:
   * DAR Submitted: The request is being validated by the internal team
   * DAR Under Review: The members of the DAC review the request and provide their feedback
   * DAR Review Completed: All the requireed feedback has been provided
   * Feedback to Applicants: The applicant is inivited to provide their feedback on the reviewers feedback
   * DAR Scheduled: The DAR is ready for the next DAC meeting
   * DAC Approved or DAR Rejected: The DAC has met and made a decision
5. Once approved by the DAC they will appear in the lower table while the project administration is completed, your data prepared and your SDE workspace established.
   * Verifying Users: The users who will have access to the data need their identities verififed and training certificates reviewed
   * Release Data Release Letter: The formal record of the data access permission
   * Provisioning Project: The data needed for the project is being prepareed in the dedicated SDE workspace
